// "Is this thing already waiting for a second person?"

// A gated delete no longer changes anything, so an operator who queues one gets
// no feedback from the list they were looking at — the row is unchanged, and
// the only evidence is a toast that scrolls away. The natural reaction is to
// click again, which queues a second identical request. Two approvers can then
// each approve one and the second executes against a target that is already
// gone, or worse, a target that has been recreated since.
//
// So every list page asks this hook before offering the delete, and the answer
// disables it. The request itself is what carries the target, which is why the
// matching is done on `target` and not on the row's own ids: the queue is the
// only place that knows what has actually been asked for.
