// Human labels for the operation discriminators the server reports.
//
// Every op the server can execute needs an entry. A missing one is not a crash
// — it renders as the raw discriminator, so `account.delete` shows up as
// `account.delete` — which is exactly why it is easy to ship without noticing.
// `features/settings/approvals/index.tsx` carries the same map for the settings
// page; the two must stay in sync with `KNOWN_OPS` on the server.
